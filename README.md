I'm an engineer. Even after decades have passed, technology still has the same buzz for me every single day.
There is so much of it out there to see and try, never a boring day.
Anyways, Java, C++ and Javascript is how you find me writing code here. Also into cross-compilers and weird protocols for radio.

That's it. Be nice to each other, have kids and use GraalVM.

I'm an engineer. Even after decades have passed, technology still has the same buzz for me every single day.
There is so much of it out there, never a boring day (except VIM, s***w that crazy editor). :-)
Anyways, Java is where I'm writing code. Also into cross-compilers and weird languages.

That's it. Be nice to each other, have kids and compile something in GraalVM.
